# my-peco-blog

This is my blog rewritten in Peco.

Peco is a static website generator that aims to be as simple as Hexo but also takes advantage of the modern front-end technology like Webpack, Vue, SSG (server-side generated).

And maybe even React support...

Peco will be realeased as soon as I finish rewriting this blog and a few other themes.
