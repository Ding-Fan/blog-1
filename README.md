# EGOIST's blog

This is my blog written in [Peco](https://github.com/egojump/peco).

Peco is a static website generator that aims to be as simple as Hexo but also takes advantage of the modern front-end technology like Webpack, Vue, SSG (server-side generated).

Peco is feature-complete for generating blog or documentation websites but is still in beta phase, only use it if you're adventurous.
